// an adapter a `URLSearchParams` and takes one back, saying nothing about where they live, so every
// parser, `useQueryStates`, `urlKeys` and `history: 'push'` keeps working. It is nuqs's own
// `adapters/react` minus what a Vite SPA has no use for: RSC, SSR, provider props, full-page
// navigation, history monkey-patching.
