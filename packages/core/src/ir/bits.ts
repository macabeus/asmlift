// KNOWN BITS over SSA values — an L2 fact about `Fn`, answered from declarations and instructions
// alone.
//
// This is not a spelling rule and it says nothing about C. It answers "how many significant bits
// can this value have", which is what every rule that needs to know whether a narrower container
// LOSES something must ask: the mask-and-insert fold's truncation bound (structure.ts), and the
// same question raise/narrowlocal.ts states for itself as "every value arriving on an in-edge is
// itself an extension of at most this width, or a constant".
//
// It is a function over `Fn` rather than a closure inside a rendering pass so that a test can ask
// it directly: reachable only through emitted C, a wrong answer for one opcode reads as a silent
// wrong address in a row nobody is looking at.
